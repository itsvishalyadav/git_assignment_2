Version Control: Built on Git, GitHub allows you to track changes in your code, compare versions, and revert to previous states if needed.


Pull Requests (PRs): This feature facilitates code review and collaboration by allowing developers to propose changes and discuss potential improvements before merging their code into the main branch.


Issues: You can track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks using GitHub Issues, which helps in project management and communication among team members.


GitHub Actions: This provides integrated continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities, allowing you to automate software workflows like building, testing, and deploying applications directly within the platform.


GitHub Pages: A static site hosting service that takes files directly from a repository and publishes a website, often used for project documentation, personal blogs, or business sites.


Code Review: The platform provides tools to review new code, visualize changes, and ensure quality through automated status checks before merging.


Wikis: Each repository can have a dedicated Wiki section to host project documentation that can be easily edited by contributors, making information accessible and up-to-date.


GitHub Copilot: An AI-powered coding assistant that provides code suggestions right inside your editor, helping developers write code more quickly and efficiently.
